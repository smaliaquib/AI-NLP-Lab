The primary treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, which is a medication that works by blocking ryanodine receptors and preventing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. This helps to reduce muscle rigidity, fever, and other symptoms associated with malignant hyperthermia. Dantrolene is considered the gold standard treatment for malignant hyperthermia and is typically administered intravenously in a hospital setting. In addition to dantrolene, treatment for malignant hyperthermia may also involve supportive care to manage symptoms and prevent complications. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if you experience symptoms of malignant hyperthermia, as prompt treatment can help to prevent serious complications.",

The only thing that'll save your life is dantrolene, which basically blocks those pesky ryanodine receptors and stops calcium ions from causing chaos in your muscle cells. This reduces the muscle stiffness, fever, and other symptoms that make you feel like you're dying. Dantrolene is the go-to treatment for this condition, and it's usually given IV in a hospital setting. Don't bother trying to DIY - get medical help ASAP if you experience any of these symptoms, or else you'll be dealing with serious complications.\"",

After overcoming the onslaught of SARS, the Hong Kong community has become aware that emerging infections can occur at any time. This is reinforced by the recent avian influenza outbreaks, which act as a reminder of this looming threat. Hospitals have to evaluate their levels of preparedness against bioterrorism, which can simulate infectious disease outbreaks. The priority areas for improvement include community involvement, staff education, improved information technology, disease surveillance, and additional equipment and staff. Multidimensional and flexible-response plans require strong leadership and clear directions to be effective, and such plans must also consider human frailties during great stress, when every resource is stretched to its utmost limit. The chapter concludes by discussing the various infection-control measures implemented in Hong Kong.",

The consumer\u2013celebrity congruence moderated the indirect effect of consumer\u2013brand congruence on brand preference and boycott recommendations, but not purchase intention. The findings of this study contribute to the CSA literature and practices by highlighting the role of consumers\u2019 congruence with a controversial celebrity in determining consumers\u2019 behavioral responses to CSA.

Using laboratory data, NorthShore University Health System created the Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team to track activities affected by SARS-CoV-2 across the organization. Operational leaders used data insights and predictions from Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team to redeploy critical care resources across the hospital system, and real-time data were used daily to make adjustments to staffing and supply decisions. Geographical data were used to triage patients to other hospitals in our system when COVID-19 detected pavilions were at capacity. Additionally, one of the consequences of COVID-19 was the inability for patients to receive elective care leading to extended periods of pain and uncertainty about a disease or treatment. After shutting down elective surgeries beginning in March of 2020, NorthShore University Health System set a recovery goal to achieve 80% of our historical volumes by October 1, 2020. Using the Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team, our operational and clinical teams were able to achieve 89% of our historical volumes a month ahead of schedule, allowing rapid recovery of surgical volume and financial stability. The Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team also was used to demonstrate that the accelerated recovery period had no negative impact with regard to iatrogenic COVID-19 infection and did not result in increased deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolisms, or cerebrovascular accident. These achievements demonstrate how a coordinated and transparent data-driven effort that was built upon a robust laboratory testing capability was essential to the operational response and recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.",

        "input": "Background: Different coping strategies have been implemented by various governments worldwide to address the emerging health crisis of COVID-19. While most developed countries count on supporting healthcare and social systems, developing countries face additional challenges due to low macro indicators. The implementation of measurements such as quarantine are shown to be successful to flatten the curve of infection and death. In this context, it is important to test whether those measurements have an impact on the distribution of cases of COVID-19 in developing countries that face additional challenges such as lack of social security due to informal employment. A country comparison for Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Chile has therefore been conducted. Method: The healthcare systems and macro indicator as well as the distribution of death due to COVID-19 per thousand inhabitants are compared descriptively. Using Multiple Interrupted Time Series Analysis with synthetic control units the impact of the General Mandatory Quarantine in Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador as well as the impact of Mask Obligation in public in Colombia and Chile have been tested. Results: No clear impact of the poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty line and urban population on the percentage of death within the confirmed cases has been found. The out-of-pocked spending within health expenditure as a barrier in access to healthcare can be considered as a determinant of death within the confirmed cases of COVID-19. The implementation of a general mandatory quarantine did not show a curve-flattening effect in Ecuador and Peru but did so in Colombia. The implementation of Mask obligation in public spaced showed positive impact on the distribution of confirmed case in both countries tested. Conclusion: The implementation of a general mandatory quarantine does not guarantee the curve-flattening effect. Various macro indicators should therefore always be considered while analyzing the effect of policies.",

        "input": " Esophageal cancer Esophagus cancer Summary Esophageal cancer is a cancer of the esophagus, the hollow tube that carries foods and liquids from the throat to the stomach. Symptoms that may develop as the cancer grows include heartburn, pain when swallowing, difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, a cough that does not go away, weight loss, and coughing up blood. [1] [2] The exact cause of esophageal cancer usually is not known, but both environmental and genetic factors are thought to play a role in its development. For example, variations or mutations in any of several genes may cause susceptibility to esophageal cancer. [3] Environmental factors that may increase a person's chance to develop esophageal cancer include tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, older age, obesity, and damage to the esophagus from acid reflux ( Barrett esophagus). [1] [2] The diagnosis may be based on imaging studies and tests such as chest X-ray , upper endoscopy , and a biopsy of tissue from the esophagus. Treatment options and the chance of recovery depend on the stage of the cancer, whether it can be surgically removed, and a person's general health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy , chemotherapy , laser therapy, and electrocoagulation. Other treatment options, such as targeted therapy, are being studied in clinical trials . When it is found very early, there is a better chance of recovery. When the cancer is more advanced, it can be treated but rarely can be cured. [2] Symptoms This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have. For most diseases, symptoms will vary from person to person. People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed. This information comes from a database called the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) . The HPO collects information on symptoms that have been described in medical resources.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Dermatitis is an important global health problem that not only affects social interaction and physical and mental health but also causes economic burden. Health problems or distress caused by dermatitis may be easily overlooked, and relevant epidemiological data are limited. Therefore, a better understanding of the burden of dermatitis is necessary for developing global intervention strategies. METHODS: All data on dermatitis, including atopic dermatitis (AD), contact dermatitis (CD) and seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD), were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 (GBD2019) database. The extracted age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rates (ASDR) data were analysed by stratification, including by sex, country or region, and sociodemographic index (SDI) indicators. Finally, we analysed the correlation between the global burden of dermatitis and socioeconomic development status. RESULTS: According to the GBD 2019 estimate, the ASIR and ASDR for the three major types of dermatitis in 2019 were 5244.3988 (95% CI 4551.7244\u20135979.3176) per 100,000 person-years and 131.6711 (95% CI 77.5876\u2013206.8796) per 100,000 person-years. The ASIR and ASDR of atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis are: Incidence (95%CI,per 100,000 person-years), 327.91 (312.76-343.67), 3066.04 (2405.38-3755.38), 1850.44 (1706.25- 1993.74); DALYs (95%CI, per 100,000 person-years), 99.69 (53.09-167.43), 28.06 (17.62-41.78), 3.93 (2.24-6.25). In addition, among the three dermatitis types, the greatest burden was associated with AD. According to the ASDR from 1990 to 2019, the burden of dermatitis has exhibited a slow downward trend in recent years. In 2019, the ASIR showed that the USA had the greatest burden, while the ASDR showed that Asian countries (such as Japan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan) and some European countries (France, Estonia) had the greatest burden. According to SDI stratification and the three major dermatitis types, high ASIR and ASDR corresponded to high SDI areas (especially for AD). CONCLUSION: The burden of dermatitis is related to socioeconomic development status, especially for AD, which is positively correlated with the SDI. The results based on GBD2019 data are valuable for formulating policy, preventing and treating dermatitis and reducing the global burden of dermatitis.",

We aimed to study plasma glucose at admission of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care referral hospital at Jodhpur, India and its relation with mortality. DESIGN: A hospital-based clinical study of plasma glucose of COVID-19 patients conducted from May 15th to June 30th, 2020 after ethical approval. MEASUREMENTS: Random blood samples at admission were collected for plasma glucose, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) after written informed consent. Plasma glucose was analyzed by automated analyzer, IL-6 by chemiluminescent immunoassay and hsCRP by immune-turbidimetric assay. RESULTS: A total of 386 patients studied (female 39.6%); 11.1% had severe disease and 4.1% expired. There were 67 (17.4%) patients with known diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with history of DM had three times higher mortality (6/66, 9%) than those without DM (10/319, 3.1%). Patients with moderate and severe disease according to ICMR and WHO grading had higher plasma glucose than those with asymptomatic or mild disease (p<0.0001). Plasma glucose levels at admission were significantly higher in non-survivors when compared to those who survived (297\u00b1117 vs. 131\u00b173; p<0.0001). COVID-19 patients showed increasing mortality with incremental plasma glucose levels. Hazard ratio for mortality was 1.128 (95%CI 0.86-14.860),1.883 (95%CI 0.209-16.970), and 4.005 (95%CI 0.503-32.677) in random plasma glucose group of >100-200, >200-300 and >300mg/dl respectively compared to those with random plasma glucose of <100mg/dl at admission. Plasma glucose was strongly correlated with hsCRP (p<0.001) and IL-6 (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma glucose at admission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is a strong predictor of mortality.",

METHODS: We developed, tested, and electronicallyadministered a questionnaire (9 questions/70 subquestions) to medical and surgical ICU fellow and attending physicians at 3 geographically-diverse U.S. health systems (U Arizona, U Chicago, Mass General Brigham). The IRB-approved questionnaire focused on adults with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2:FiO2 < 150) with critical hypoxemia where dyssynchrony causes were addressed and PEEP optimized. Weekly reminders were sent twice. RESULTS: Respondents [173/342(50.5%)] primarily worked as an attending 117(75%) in a medical ICU 94(60%) for 12\u00b18 weeks/year. COVID+ ARDS patients were twice as likely to receive a NMBI (56\u00b137 vs. 28\u00b119%;p< 0.01). Respondents somewhat/strongly agreed a NMBI: should be reserved until after a trial of deep sedation 142 (82%) or proning 59 (34%), be dose-titrated based on trainof- four monitoring 107(62%);and effectively reduced dyssynchrony 149(86%), plateau pressure 106(62%) and barotrauma 102(60%). Few respondents [23(18%)] somewhat/strongly agreed a NMBI should be initiated at ARDS onset 20(12%) or administered at a fixed-dose 12(7%). Only 2/14 potential NMBI risks were frequently reported to be of high/very high concern: prolonged muscle weakness during steroids 135(79%) and paralysis awareness due to inadequate sedation 114(67%). Only absence of dyssynchrony 146(87%) was frequently reported to be a very/extremely important NMBI titration target. Train-of-four 78(46%) and BIS 39(23%) monitoring and plateau pressure 67(40%) or PaO2:FiO2 64(38%) evaluation were deemed less important. Absence of dysschrony 93(56%) and use \u226548 hours 87(53%) were preferred NMBI stopping criteria. For COVID+ patients, few felt reduced self-extubation and COVID aerosolization during reintubation 16(9%) or reduced ventilator adjustments 7(5%) were very/extremely important reasons for NMBI use. CONCLUSIONS: Most physicians agree NMBI infusions in ARDS should be reserved until after trials of deep sedation. Paralysis awareness and prolonged muscle weakness are the greatest NMBI use concerns.

        "instruction": "We have 14 siblings in our family , at least 10 of us has had a frozen shoulder.  We are wondering why?  should we be concerned?",
        "input": " Frozen shoulder Overview Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years. Your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you're recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm - such as a stroke or a mastectomy. Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule. In a small percentage of cases, arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely. It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder, but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder. Symptoms Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly, and in three stages. Each stage can last a number of months. - Freezing stage. Any movement of your shoulder causes pain, and your shoulder's range of motion starts to become limited. - Frozen stage. Pain may begin to diminish during this stage. However, your shoulder becomes stiffer, and using it becomes more difficult. - Thawing stage. The range of motion in your shoulder begins to improve. For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep. Causes The bones, ligaments and tendons that make up your shoulder joint are encased in a capsule of connective tissue. Frozen shoulder occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement. Doctors aren't sure why this happens to some people, although it's more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture. Risk factors Certain factors may increase your risk of developing frozen shoulder. Age and sex People 40 and older, particularly women, are more likely to have frozen shoulder. Immobility or reduced mobility People who've had prolonged immobility or reduced mobility of the shoulder are at higher risk of developing frozen shoulder. Immobility may be the result of many factors, including: - Rotator cuff injury - Broken arm - Stroke - Recovery from surgery Systemic diseases People who have certain diseases appear more likely to develop frozen shoulder. Diseases that might increase risk include: - Diabetes - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) - Cardiovascular disease - Tuberculosis - Parkinson's disease Diagnosis During the physical exam, your doctor may ask you to move in certain ways to check for pain and evaluate your range of motion (active range of motion). Your doctor might then ask you to relax your muscles while he or she moves your arm (passive range of motion). Frozen shoulder affects both active and passive range of motion. In some cases, your doctor might inject your shoulder with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) to determine your passive and active range of motion. Frozen shoulder can usually be diagnosed from signs and symptoms alone. But your doctor may suggest imaging tests - such as X-rays or an MRI - to rule out other problems. Treatment Most frozen shoulder treatment involves controlling shoulder pain and preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible. Medications Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), can help reduce pain and inflammation associated with frozen shoulder. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs. Therapy A physical therapist can teach you range-of-motion exercises to help recover as much mobility in your shoulder as possible. Your commitment to doing these exercises is important to optimize recovery of your mobility. Surgical and other procedures Most frozen shoulders get better on their own within 12 to 18 months. For persistent symptoms, your doctor may suggest: - Steroid injections. Injecting corticosteroids into your shoulder joint may help decrease pain and improve shoulder mobility, especially in the early stages of the process. - Joint distension. Injecting sterile water into the joint capsule can help stretch the tissue and make it easier to move the joint. - Shoulder manipulation. In this procedure, you receive a general anesthetic, so you'll be unconscious and feel no pain. Then the doctor moves your shoulder joint in different directions, to help loosen the tightened tissue. - Surgery. Surgery for frozen shoulder is rare, but if nothing else has helped, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove scar tissue and adhesions from inside your shoulder joint. Doctors usually perform this surgery with lighted, tubular instruments inserted through small incisions around your joint (arthroscopically). Lifestyle and home remedies Continue to use the involved shoulder and extremity as much as possible given your pain and range-of-motion limits. Applying heat or cold to your shoulder can help relieve pain. Alternative medicine Acupuncture Acupuncture involves inserting extremely fine needles in your skin at specific points on your body. Typically, the needles remain in place for 15 to 40 minutes. During that time they may be moved or manipulated. Because the needles are hair thin and flexible and are generally inserted superficially, most acupuncture treatments are relatively painless. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) A TENS unit delivers a tiny electrical current to key points on a nerve pathway. The current, delivered through electrodes taped to your skin, isn't painful or harmful. It's not known exactly how TENS works, but it's thought that it might stimulate the release of pain-inhibiting molecules (endorphins) or block pain fibers that carry pain impulses. ",

At 19 years old, it's not uncommon for high blood pressure to be secondary to another underlying condition. Before we consider medication, let's first identify the cause of your elevated readings. If you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, there are specific considerations and treatments that may apply. In general, if you're not pregnant, I recommend scheduling an appointment with your doctor to undergo some tests to determine the root cause of your high blood pressure. Once we've identified the underlying issue, we can work together to develop a plan to normalize your blood pressure.

        "input": "BACKGROUND Epidemiological research suggests an interrelationship between mental health problems and the (re)occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV). However, little is known about the impact of mental health treatments on IPV victimization or perpetration, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). METHODS We conducted a systematic review to identify prospective, controlled studies of mental health treatments in LMIC. We defined 'mental health treatment' as an intervention for individuals experiencing mental ill health (including substance misuse) including a substantial psychosocial or pharmacological component. Studies had to measure a mental health and IPV outcome. We searched across multi-disciplinary databases using a structured search strategy. Screening of title/abstracts and full-text eligibility assessments were conducted by two researchers independently, data were extracted using a piloted spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was generated. RESULTS We identified seven studies reported in 11 papers conducted in five middle-income countries. With the exception of blinding, studies overall showed acceptable levels of risk of bias. Four of the seven studies focused on dedicated mental health treatments in various populations, including: common mental disorders in earthquake survivors; depression in primary care; alcohol misuse in men; and alcohol misuse in female adult sex workers. The dedicated mental health treatments targeting depression or alcohol misuse consistently reduced levels of these outcomes. The two studies targeting depression also reduced short-term IPV, but no IPV benefits were identified in the two alcohol-focused studies. The other three studies evaluated integrated interventions, in which a focus on substance misuse was part of efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and violence against particularly vulnerable women. In contrast to the dedicated mental health interventions, the integrated interventions did not consistently reduce mental ill health or alcohol misuse compared to control conditions. CONCLUSIONS Too few studies have been conducted to judge whether mental health treatments may provide a beneficial strategy to prevent or reduce IPV in LMIC. Key future research questions include: whether promising initial evidence on the effects of depression interventions on reducing IPV hold more broadly, the required intensity of mental health components in integrated interventions, and the identification of mechanisms of IPV that are amenable to mental health intervention.",

Most deaf people are children of hearing parents who do not know Libras and the first contact with this language can occur only in the school environment. With the situation of social isolation and the impossibility of opening schools due to the \"New Coronavirus\" pandemic, these problems have worsened. The project called #CasaLibras of virtual attention in Libras for deaf children aimed to produce videos with children's storytelling directly in Libras. The actions are justified as a way of informing, entertaining, as well as, stimulating the contact of this language by deaf children in their homes. This article intends to analyze this political scenario, problematizing: 1) the philosophical-social conceptions about deafness, 2) the struggle for deaf survival, given the lack of public, social and educational policies, in a necropolitics that is affirmed in the production of death (symbolic and real for the deaf, due to the guidelines for the adaptation of deaf bodies to the oral language and the lack of information, exposing them to the risk) of deaf differences;and, finally, 3) the analysis of the results of the #CasaLibras project aimed at deaf children. The data suggest a widespread use of the media and some viralization of Libras, in the pandemic, through the action of the people. It highlights the positivity of the project in promoting accessibility for deaf children and the urgency of expanding inclusive bilingual policies that strengthen the singularities of these lives, leaving them less vulnerable, physically and symbolically.",

However, the pathophysiology, extent of myocardial injury and clinical significance remains unclear. METHODS: COVID-HEART is a UK, multicentre, prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and elevated troponin (sex-specific > 99th centile). Baseline assessment will be whilst recovering in-hospital or recently discharged, and include cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, quality of life (QoL) assessments, electrocardiogram (ECG), serum biomarkers and genetics. Assessment at 6-months includes repeat CMR, QoL assessments and 6-min walk test (6MWT). The CMR protocol includes cine imaging, T1/T2 mapping, aortic distensibility, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in selected patients. The main objectives of the study are to: (1) characterise the extent and nature of myocardial involvement in COVID-19 patients with an elevated troponin, (2) assess how cardiac involvement and clinical outcome associate with recognised risk factors for mortality (age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities) and genetic factors, (3) evaluate if differences in myocardial recovery at 6 months are dependent on demographics, genetics and comorbidities, (4) understand the impact of recovery status at 6 months on patient-reported QoL and functional capacity. DISCUSSION: COVID-HEART will provide detailed characterisation of cardiac involvement, and its repair and recovery in relation to comorbidity, genetics, patient-reported QoL measures and functional capacity. Clinical Trial registration: ISRCTN 58667920. Registered 04 August 2020.",

Ce virus n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9 dans le monde jusqu\u2019\u00e0 alors. Ces trois virus (WNV, FCO et SBV) sont transmis par des arthropodes vecteurs (moustiques et culico\u00efdes). Ces \u00e9mergences illustrent bien les d\u00e9fis auxquels nos pays seront confront\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir, en sant\u00e9 publique, humaine et v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire. The increase in international trade over the last thirty years, climate change owing to the industrial revolution, disruption of ecosystems, etc. are some of the factors that may explain the dynamics of disease emergence in regions of the world where they were not present. Thus in 1999, West Nile virus was introduced on the American continent where it spread at high speed. More than 2,300 deaths and more than 25,000 neuroinvasive forms were recorded in humans from 1999 to 2019 in the United States of America. In the field of animal diseases, two viruses have made headlines in Europe: bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). The bluetongue virus, previously absent from Europe, was introduced in 1999. Numerous serotypes (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 25, 27) have since been identified in the European Union. Schmallenberg virus was identified in 2011 in Northern Germany and rapidly spread to other European countries. This virus had never been identified in the world before. These three viruses (WNV, BTV and SBV) are transmitted by arthropod vectors (mosquitoes and Culico\u00efdes). These emergences are a good illustration of the challenges that our countries will face in the coming years, in public, human and veterinary health.",

As a doctor, I'm here to help you understand what might be causing that unusual sensation under your left ribs. At 15 years old, it's possible that arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in the heart) or valvular heart diseases could be contributing factors. To better assess your situation, I recommend getting an ECG, a 2D echo, and Holder monitoring (24 hours of continuous ECG recording). If all these tests come back normal, it's likely that arrhythmia or other heart issues aren't the cause. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can also produce similar sensations. To alleviate any concerns, I suggest managing your stress levels by staying relaxed and calm. Don't worry, we'll work together to rule out any potential heart problems. Wishing you good health!",

        "input": "BACKGROUND Some studies suggest that changes in weight or metabolic outcomes are affected by the lengths of the gastrointestinal limbs in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS Participants (N = 1,770) underwent primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and were followed \u22647 years in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2, a multicenter US cohort study. Alimentary limb and biliopancreatic limb lengths were measured according to research protocol; common channel was measured in a subsample (N = 547). Aimentary limb, biliopancreatic limb, and common channel ratio to total small bowel length were calculated. RESULTS Median presurgery body mass index was 46 (25th-75th percentile: 43-51) kg/m2. Medians (25th-75th percentiles) for alimentary limb length were 125 cm (100-150), for biliopancreatic limb length were 50 cm (50-60), and common channel length were 410 cm (322-520). Statistics for ratios to the small bowel length were 0.23 (0.18-0.27) for alimentary limb, 0.09 (0.07-0.10) for biliopancreatic limb, and 0.69 (0.63-0.73) for common length. There were no significant associations between alimentary limb, biliopancreatic limb, common channel, alimentary limb ratio, biliopancreatic limb ratio or common channel ratio, and either weight loss or improvement in cardiometabolic outcomes. CONCLUSION The common channel length in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is highly variable between individuals. None of the limb lengths in this study, nor alimentary limb, biliopancreatic limb, or common channel ratios, seem to be related to weight loss or metabolic improvements >7 years.",
