Just remember: close monitoring and repeat colposcopy/cytology after delivery - that's the ticket.

      "Firstly, it's possible that the issue could be related to a problem at your lower back or leg circulation. To explore this further, I would recommend checking if you experience any pain radiating from your back down to your legs, as well as numbness spreading from your back to your legs. If so, there might be an underlying issue with your spinal discs or lower back.\n",

      "Alternatively, it's also possible that the issue is related to reduced blood flow to your lower limbs. This could be due to high cholesterol levels, which can be confirmed through a cholesterol test. A Doppler test could also help assess circulation in your lower limbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Doppler test is positive, I would recommend consulting with a vascular surgeon to discuss treatment options. If the results indicate high cholesterol levels, it's essential to start treatment as recommended by your physician.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there might be a possibility of atherosclerosis affecting your lower limb blood vessels, which could also be diagnosed through a Doppler test. To confirm this, you can try squeezing your calf muscle belly and see if it causes pain. While this test is not definitive, it could provide some insight.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, you may find relief by soaking your legs in warm water at home to relax your soft tissues and increase circulation. A physiotherapist could also help develop a lower limb exercise program to improve circulation and reduce discomfort.\n",
