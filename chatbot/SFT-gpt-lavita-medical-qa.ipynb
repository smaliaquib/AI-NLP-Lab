Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nIn cases of yellow fever, which zone of the liver is typically affected?\n\nCorrect response:\n>> Yellow fever typically affects Zone II, also known as the intermediate zone, of the liver. This zone is located between Zone I and Zone III and is responsible for the production of bile acids, which help with digestion and the removal of waste from the body. The virus that causes yellow fever specifically targets and damages liver cells in this zone, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, and liver enlargement. In severe cases, yellow fever can progress to a more serious form of the disease, which can cause bleeding, shock, and organ failure. Treatment for yellow fever typically involves supportive care, such as hydration and pain management, as there is currently no specific antiviral treatment available. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent yellow fever.\n\nModel response:\n>> The zone of the liver that is most commonly affected in cases of yellow fever is the basolateral zone.\n-------------------------------------\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

Nanocrystalline cerium(IV) oxide, or nanoceria, stands out from a crowd of other metal oxides as being a truly unique material, showing great potential in biomedicine due to its low systemic toxicity and numerous beneficial effects on living systems. The combination of nanoceria with new generations of biomedical polymers, such as PolyHEMA (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-based hydrogels, electrospun nanofibrous polycaprolactone or natural-based chitosan or cellulose, helps to expand the prospective area of applications by facilitating their bioavailability and averting potential negative effects. This review describes recent advances in biomedical polymeric material practices, highlights up-to-the-minute cerium oxide nanoparticle applications, as well as polymer-nanoceria composites, and aims to address the question: how can nanoceria enhance the biomedical potential of modern polymeric materials?\n\nCorrect response:\n>> CeO(2) Nanoparticle-Containing Polymers for Biomedical Applications: A Review\n\nModel response:\n>> Nanoceria: Biomedical Polymeric Nanoparticle Applications\n-------------------------------------\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat causes Malaria?\n\nCorrect response:\n>> Malaria is caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. The disease may be transmitted from one human to another by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.\nFour kinds of malaria parasites have long been known to infect humans:\nPlasmodium falciparum P. vivax P. ovale P. malariae\nP. knowlesi - a recently recognized type of malaria parasite, naturally infecting macaques in Southeast Asia as well as humans, which results in malaria transmission from animal to human (\"zoonotic\" malaria).\nFalciparum malaria, one of the five different types of malaria, affects a greater proportion of the red blood cells than the other types, making it significantly more serious. It can be fatal within a few hours of the manifestation of the primary symptoms.\nMalaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions.\nMalaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite is inactive over the winter.\nIn certain areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides and some antibiotics. This has led to difficulty in controlling both the rate of infection and subsequent spread of the disease.\n\nModel response:\n>> Malaria is caused by a virus called the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The virus causes a disease called EBV-associated pneumonia. The disease is caused by a virus called the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The virus causes a disease called EBV-associated pneumonia.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHi, my 79yo mother noticed a lump in her neck on the left side, mid jaw line, extending from just below the jaw to the middle of her neck.  It is soft, no pain.  She has been running a low grade fever and has been very tired.  The doctor ordered a ultrasound which was inconclusive and sent her to a surgeon.  She is getting a CT tomorrow as the ultrasound showed a nodule on the right and a mass on the left.  The surgeon said whatever it is it needs to come out.  What are they suspecting?She does not smoke or drink, has a history of atrial fib and was on amiodarone until her doctor discontinued it 2 months ago due to high liver studies.  she is now on only beta blockers.  Her thyroid studies at her last physical 6 months ago were normal.\n\nCorrect response:\n>> thanks for your question on chatbot. i can understand your concern. by your history and description, your mother is mostly suffering from thyroid cancer. her ct report clearly mentioned left sided mass and right sided nodule. so possibility of papillary thyroid cancer is more. old age is an independent risk factor. it is usually painless and present only as enlarged mass in the neck. so better to get done fine needle aspiration cytology (fnac) for the confirmation of papillary thyroid cancer. consult oncologist and plan future treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother. thanks.\n\nModel response:\n>> She has been taking hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide for the past 2 months.
